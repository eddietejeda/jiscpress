Data transferred between two Amazon Web Services within the same region (i.e. between Amazon EC2 US and another AWS service in the US, or between Amazon EC2 Europe and another AWS service in Europe) is free of charge (i.e., $0.00 per GB). Data transferred between AWS services in different regions will be charged as Internet Data Transfer on both sides of the transfer. For example, the following data transfers will be charged: between Amazon EC2 US and Amazon EC2 Europe or Amazon S3 Europe; between Amazon EC2 Europe and Amazon EC2 US, Amazon S3 US, Amazon SDB or Amazon SQS. Data transferred between Amazon EC2 US and Amazon S3 buckets created without the will be free of charge. All other charges for these services will still apply.

Usage for other Amazon Web Services is billed separately from Amazon EC2.
