= Publishing a JISCPress document =

== Introduction ==

JISCPress is a WordPress-based platform so many of the same methods and conventions for writing a WordPress blog post apply to JISCPress. The significant difference is that JISCPress documents occupy an entire 'blog' or WordPress site. This allows you to divide your document into sections and each section is a WordPress blog post.  It can get confusing discussing blog posts and document sections, so from hereon, note the following:

WordPress blog site = A single JISCPress document
WordPress blog post = A single JISCPress document section

You can publish large (100 + section) documents or small (1 section) documents on JISCPress. It helps if your sections are relatively short. We are, afterall, publishing on the web, and long sections will take longer for the reader to download in their browser. There is nothing to stop you publishing sub-sections separately.

== How JISCPress works ==

JISCPress uses [http://digress.it digress.it] to transform your site into a self-contained document with a Table of Contents. digress.it automatically discovers the paragraphs in each document section and assigns them a unique link (URI) so that people can comment on specific paragraphs of text.

Other parts of your document structure are also auto-discovered by digress.it. If you have images, tables or lists in your document, digress.it will find those and assign a unique link for those, too. Our tests have shown digress.it to be very accurate in reading your document section structure and you should not have to make any adjustments. If you repeatedly find a problem, please let us know.

digress.it has options to allow you to order your sections in a number of ways. However, the simplest option is to author your document sections in chronological order, starting with the title page or introduction and finishing with the conclusion of the document.  Normally, WordPress would publish blog posts, with the most recent, first. digress.it merely reverses the order and displays the sections in the order that you authored them (unless you have configured it otherwise).

Headings, block quotes and other formatting conventions are discovered by digress.it and should be retained in the final document. As with any Wordpress site, you can significantly alter the presentation of a site by developing your own WordPress theme or making adjustments to the stylesheet of an existing theme. digress.it allows you to select different stylesheets. Currently we offer two: 'default' and 'classic'.
