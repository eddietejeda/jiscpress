= Introduction =

This page documents our testing of desktop blog publishing software that use the XML-RPC and/or AtomPub specifications. Our objective is to ensure compatibility with JISCPress so that as little re-formatting is required to re-publish a document originally authored in popular word processing software. The most popular remote publishing client software has been chosen for Windows, OS X and Linux desktops.

Site used: http://remotepub.jiscpress.org/

=Methodology=

For the testing of each client, the [http://jisc.ac.uk/fundingopportunities/funding_calls/2009/03/309ricall.aspx original word document] for the #jiscri call was used. The entire text was selected ('select all'), copied and pasted into the client software and published as a single post to examine how JISCPress (using the Digress plugin and default theme) would format the document without any intervention.  We aim to achieve a document presentation which is consistent across the entire document and clearly divides paragraphs and other elements into logical 'atomised' parts which can be commented on.  Where this was clearly not achieved on first attempt, we document the changes we made to achieve this and possible improvements to JISCPress to accommodate these issues.
